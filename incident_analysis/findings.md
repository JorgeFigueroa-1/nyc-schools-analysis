🔗 [My Google Sheet] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kGlLEjQnQ3mn847e9ezfw10Dqh-i7acLwoFoQlESDMM/edit?usp=sharing

Answers:

* Total rows in the dataset: 6,310
* Total unique schools listed: 2,266
* Most frequent incident type: Non-criminal
* Percentage of incidents in the Bronx: 28.24%

Observations:

* The dataset is fairly large (6,310 rows) and covers many schools (2,266 unique schools), so the results represent a wide range of locations.
* Most reported incidents are non-criminal, which suggests that many issues are lower-level behavior or safety concerns rather than serious crimes.
* The school with the highest incident rate per 100 students is hospital_schools__queens, with about 133 incidents per 100 students. This very high rate is likely related to the special context and small enrollment of this hospital school.
