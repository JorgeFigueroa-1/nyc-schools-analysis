# NYC Schools Data Analysis

End-to-end NYC public schools data project using **Python** and **PostgreSQL** for cleaning, exploration, database loading, and SQL-based reporting.

This repository reorganizes my onboarding work into a portfolio-ready project, structured by task rather than by day.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Explore NYC public school data (directory and related datasets).
- Analyze incident / safety data at the school level.
- Clean and transform the datasets to be loaded into a relational database.
- Run SQL queries from Python to answer analytical questions.
- Document the workflow and results clearly.

🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/JorgeFigueroa-1/nyc-schools-analysis.git
cd nyc-schools-analysis

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

3. Install dependencies (if you add a requirements.txt later):

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the notebooks in your environment (e.g. Jupyter Lab or VS Code) and run the analyses step by step

📌 Notes

This project was created as part of an onboarding assignment and then refactored into a single, public portfolio repository.
